Here are some of the organizations responding to the Rohingya refugee crisis. Some are trying to gain access to restricted areas of the western state of Rakhine in Myanmar, where many ethnic Rohingya Muslims remain. Most of the aid has been focused on camps in Bangladesh where hundreds of thousands have fled over the past month.
More information can be found through services that track and rate charity groups, including GuideStar and Charity Navigator.BRAC, a group founded in Bangladesh, was ranked the No. 1 nongovernmental organization in the world by NGO Advisor. Of the 1,300 staff members directly serving the refugee population in Cox Bazar, Bangladesh, many are locals who speak a dialect similar to that of the Rohingya in Rakhine State.

	Myanmar has barred the experts from visiting the country, but they visited the region, including refugee camps in Bangladesh Cox Bazar district, beginning early this month."Due to the gravity of the past and continuing violations, attention must be given to the political, economic and financial ties of the Myanmar military, to identify who and what should be targeted," Sidoti said.

 Government spokesman Zaw Htay did not immediately answer a telephone call to seek comment.Military spokesman Major General Tun Tun Nyi said the military would investigate allegations backed by evidence but the fact-finding mission had levelled false accusations at troops.
 "Our country is an independent country, so we don't accept our matters being interfered with," he told Reuters by telephone.<br>
The military was cooperating with a government-appointed panel on alleged abuses in Rakhine, Tun Tun Nyi said. Human rights campaigners say it lacks credibility.
